	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time complexity of an algorithm measures how efficient
		it performs as the input size grows, determining its scalability and resource usage.</p>
	<p>The <b>Space Complexity </b>of an algorithm is O(n), meaning that the amount of memory required 
		grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
